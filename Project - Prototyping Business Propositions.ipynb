    "In business, prototyping involves making an approximate analysis with some lax assumptions to evaluate a business proposition, instead of making a full-fledged analysis.\n",
    "In business environments, there's a large swath of people who we may need to communicate with. They will have varying degrees of data literacy, which makes it harder to not only report results, but also:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Makes it harder for these colleagues to request things of us\n",
    "- Makes it harder for us to manage a large and varied influx of requests\n",

    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "We're working for one of Google's data science teams and someone from another team, specifically an account manager — \"a person who works for a company and is responsible for the management of sales and relationships with particular customers\" — approaches you with a request. She wants to take a prophylactic approach and improve the revenue of undervalued apps to motivate the developers to keep working on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since her department's budget for marketing won't allow her to invest on ads (which would boost the number of sales), the only way to improve the revenue is by tweaking the price. She requests that we determine which paid apps are undervalued (undervalued here means that their price could be increased without lowering demand).\n",
    "\n",
    "We talk it over with our manager and ou come to the decision of **prototyping** this project, that is, making a rough analysis with some lax assumptions, instead of making a full-fledged analysis. Prototyping has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having a prototype makes it much easier to estimate the cost of a fully fleshed-out project, be it human, technological, or financial resources.\n",
    "- Having a more accurate estimate of the cost allows decision-makers to not go through with the project if it doesn't seem profitable enough, or not the best allocation of resources at that point in time.\n",
    "- It allows grunt workers (like ourselves) to change and add missing requirements to complete the project. Oftentimes these are overlooked and only spotted later; some examples are missing data, the creation of a new database, the development of an API.\n",
    "- It allows business people (like the account manager) to tweak the project's goal.\n",
    "- It gives all stakeholders an opportunity to add easily accomplishable side-goals given the main goal, thus maximizing the project's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the above, we should not only limit the scope of the project (focus on one goal) when prototyping, but we should also timebox it — prototypes without deadlines run the danger of becoming time wasters that do not let us capitalize on the above advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset** We'll be using The Google Playstore apps`googleplaystore.csv` dataset available at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and leverage the power of pandas!  "
